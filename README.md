# ALL BATTLE

This is a project that took months that I wrote to learn how to present and work with about 700k battles and all the stats associated with it.

I modified pokemon emerald so I could run AI Vs AI battle and rank them inspired by a video on doing in pokemon red [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=8yUPhRJtNJM&t=0s)
